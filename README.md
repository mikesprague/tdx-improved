## :construction: Work in Progress

![TDX Improved Colors](tdx-improved.png)

We use [TeamDynamix](https://www.teamdynamix.com) for issue tracking where I'm currently contracting.
I'm not the biggest fan of the software but have to spend a fair amount of time in it daily so I'll be
addressing some of the pain points I've hit while using it here.

This repo will start with some userstyles to improve the appearance of TDX from it's incredibly bright,
all white, in your face, mostly default-Bootstrap styles to something I find more bearable.

**Please Note:** On the off chance anyone finds this repo, and has a use for it, please understand
this is very much a work in progress and I'm focusing on the "screens" I spend the most time looking
at first.

### :memo: General Notes

All styles are in :file-folder:`src/scss/` and any edits should be done there. You can run
`npm run scss` from the project root and it will watch for your changes and automatically compile
the stylesheets in :file-folder:`build/css/`.

TODO: Automate the building of the `build/userstyles-mozilla.css` file. Currently, the file is
being built manually - I copy the generated styles into the corresponding sections of that file.

### :sparkles: Installation

Currently, you must use a 3rd party browser extension that supports userstles. I, personally, use
Stylus these days but formerly used Stylish. Both are available for most browsers. NOTE: Stylus has
an option to automatically check for updates to installed userstyles - I'm not sure if that feature
is available in Stylish or not.

The userstyle can be installed via userstyles.org ([https://userstyles.org/styles/156692/tdx-improved](https://userstyles.org/styles/156692/tdx-improved))
and the latest version will always be available there.

#### :calendar: Future Plans

I intend to turn this into a browser extension which will inject the styles (removing the need for
Stylish, Stylus or any other 3rd party extensions) and will also use JS to add some additional
client-side functionality to TDX. This will all happen as I need and as I get to it, no timetable
for these enhancements currently.
